# Book Search Engine

## Description

As an avid reader I want to search for new books to read so that I can keep a list of books to purchase.

Given  a book search engine when I load the search engine then I am presented with a menu with the options Search for Books and Login/Signup and an input field to search for books and a submit button.

When I click on the Search for Books menu option then I am presented with an input field to search for books and a submit button.
When I am not logged in and enter a search term in the input field and click the submit button then I am presented with several search results, each featuring a book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site.
When  I click on the Login/Signup menu option then a modal appears on the screen with a toggle between the option to log in or sign up.
When the toggle is set to Signup then I am presented with three inputs for a username, an email address, and a password, and a signup button.
When the toggle is set to Login then I am presented with two inputs for an email address and a password and login button.
When I enter a valid email address and create a password and click on the signup button then my user account is created and I am logged in to the site.
When I enter my account’s email address and password and click on the login button then I the modal closes and I am logged in to the site.
When I am logged in to the site then the menu options change to Search for Books, an option to see my saved books, and Logout.
When I am logged in and enter a search term in the input field and click the submit button then I am presented with several search results, each featuring a book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site and a button to save a book to my account.
When I click on the Save button on a book then that book’s information is saved to my account.
When I click on the option to see my saved book then I am presented with all of the books I have saved to my account, each featuring the book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site and a button to remove a book from my account.
When I click on the Remove button on a boo then that book is deleted from my saved books list.
When I click on the Logout button then I am logged out of the site and presented with a menu with the options Search for Books and Login/Signup and an input field to search for books and a submit button.
